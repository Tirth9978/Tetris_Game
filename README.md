# 🎮 Tetris Game in C++ (IT206 DS Lab - Project 2) 🚀

## 🔥 Overview

This project is a **console-based Tetris game** developed in **C++**, following object-oriented programming principles. The game features **classic Tetris mechanics**, including falling tetrominoes, piece rotation, scoring, and game-over conditions.

## ✨ Features

🎯 **Classic Tetris Gameplay**: Includes seven standard tetrominoes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L).  
🎮 **Game Board**: A **10x20** grid representation for smooth gameplay.  
🔄 **Piece Movements**: Move left, right, rotate, and drop pieces.  
⚡ **Gravity & Speed Increase**: Tetrominoes fall at a constant speed, increasing as the game progresses.  
🛑 **Collision Detection**: Prevents pieces from overlapping or moving out of bounds.  
🏆 **Line Clearing & Scoring**: Full rows are removed, and points are awarded.  
☠️ **Game Over Detection**: Ends when blocks reach the top.
